# Snake Bytes Dinner Planner

✨ [LIVE DEMO](https://kazvee.pythonanywhere.com/) ✨  

## Description

Snake Bytes Dinner Planner is a weekly meal planning app written in Python that uses the Flask framework. 

## Use Case

After buying groceries for the upcoming week, users can enter meal ideas based on the items they purchased, allowing the app to generate a personalized dinner plan. 🍽️

This helps eliminate the daily dilemma of deciding what to cook after a long day and ensures that the groceries are used efficiently, reducing food waste and spoilage. 🌍

The app shuffles the user's meal ideas and creates a weekly dinner plan. As an added bonus, it includes a randomly scheduled Treat Night — because who wants to cook _every single day_?! 😄
